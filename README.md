# Intro to using Julia
This repository is part of the assignment of Statistical Methods for Machine Learning II at the Univeristy of Toronto.

* `.gitignore` - tells git to ignore certain kinds of files. 
* `A0.jmd` - the source code used to generate the assignment document, with the final writeup in a LaTeX `.tex` document, and a standard Julia `.jl` file.
* `A0.pdf` - the text of the assignment.
* `Project.toml` - the Julia environment, specifying packages and versions you can use to complete the programming questions. You can activate this environment by opening this project folder, and inside the Julia REPL typing: `] activate .`
* `make_pdf.jl` - a short Julia script that contains the code used to produce A0.pdf from A0.jmd.
